In order to run the code, please make sure you have the required dependencies installed.
You should use a virtual environment to install them if possible.

To run the code, simply navigate to the folder where this repo was installed in the command line 
and run the following:

```python3 main.py```

And it should create the output files asked for by the outline for this assignment.
Please make sure the input files are in the same folder, because the file opening requires
them to be in the same folder.

```
Note: Depending on how python is installed on your system, you may have to run the command 
differently. Just know that you only need to pass the file to the interpreter to properly run 
the assignment.
```
