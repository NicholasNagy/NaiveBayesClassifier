In order to run the code, please make sure you have the required dependencies installed.
The dependencies are specified in the requirements.txt file and can be installed using pip
as such:

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

You should use a virtual environment to install them if possible.

To run the code, simply navigate to the folder where this repo was installed in the command line 
and run the following:

```python3 main.py```

And it should create the output files asked for by the outline for this assignment.
Please make sure the input files are in the same folder, because the file opening requires
them to be in the same folder.

```
Note: Depending on how python and pip are installed on your system, you may have to run the command 
differently. Just know that when running the assignment you only need to pass main.py to the interpreter to properly run the assignment, and just make sure that the requirements specified in the requirements.txt file are properly installed.
```
